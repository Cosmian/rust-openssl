# Local installation for OpenSSL 3.1.0
One may use `$ source setup.sh` for automatic OpenSSL installation. One must also be aware that environment variables are exported in this script. The user would need to re-export them or use preloading variables upon running such as `OPENSSL_CONF=.../openssl.cnf cargo run` if they no longer exist.


# Configuring OpenSSL
One last step must be done manually. The local installation must be told which non-default FIPS module to use. To do so, you can enable FIPS usage for all applications using the non-default OpenSSL configuration file freshly installed. Edit your `$OPENSSL_DIR/ssl/openssl.cnf` file to contain the following data and change `.include /YOUR/PATH/TO/OPENSSL/LOCAL/INSTALL/ssl/fipsmodule.cnf` accordingly.

```
# For FIPS
# Optionally include a file that is generated by the OpenSSL fipsinstall
# application. This file contains configuration data required by the OpenSSL
# fips provider. It contains a named section e.g. [fips_sect] which is
# referenced from the [provider_sect] below.
# Refer to the OpenSSL security policy for more information.
.include /YOUR/PATH/TO/OPENSSL/LOCAL/INSTALL/ssl/fipsmodule.cnf

[ openssl_init ]
providers = provider_sect

# List of providers to load
[ provider_sect ]
# The fips section name should match the section name inside the
# included fipsmodule.cnf.
fips = fips_sect
base = base_sect

[ base_sect ]
activate = 1
```
